I used for the first time the position and transform properties to center a div

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
  height: 100vh;
}

.inside {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate3d(-50%, 50%);
}
```

I want to make steps towards having improving my skills.
